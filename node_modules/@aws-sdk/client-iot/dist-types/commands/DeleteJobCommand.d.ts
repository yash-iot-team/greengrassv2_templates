/**
 * <p>Deletes a job and its related job executions.</p>
 *          <p>Deleting a job may take time, depending on the number of job
 *         executions created for the job and various other factors. While the job
 *         is being deleted, the status of the job will be shown as
 *         "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS". Attempting to delete or cancel a job whose status
 *         is already "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" will result in an error.</p>
 *          <p>Only 10 jobs may have status "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" at the same time, or
 *         a LimitExceededException will occur.</p>
 *          <p>Requires permission to access the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions">DeleteJob</a> action.</p>

 * import { IoTClient, DeleteJobCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iot"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IoTClient, DeleteJobCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iot"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IoTClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteJobCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteJobCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteJobCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IoTClientResolvedConfig | config} for IoTClient's `config` shape.
