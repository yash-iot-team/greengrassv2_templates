/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified policy.</p>
 *          <p>A policy cannot be deleted if it has non-default versions or it is attached to any
 *          certificate.</p>
 *          <p>To delete a policy, use the <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> action to delete all non-default
 *          versions of the policy; use the <a>DetachPolicy</a> action to detach the policy from any
 *          certificate; and then use the DeletePolicy action to delete the policy.</p>
 *          <p>When a policy is deleted using DeletePolicy, its default version is deleted with
 *          it.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Because of the distributed nature of Amazon Web Services, it can take up to five minutes after
 *          a policy is detached before it's ready to be deleted.</p>

 * const client = new IoTClient(config);
 * const command = new DeletePolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeletePolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeletePolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IoTClientResolvedConfig | config} for IoTClient's `config` shape.
